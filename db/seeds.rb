sarah = Writing.create(title: "My Name Is Not Sarah, But God I Wish It Was:
by Meredith".html_safe, content: "<p>My name isn't Sarah. Do I really have to say more? Everyday for me is a waking nightmare. When I wake up in the morning looking at myself in the mirror as I brush my teeth, not caring if tears get mixed in with my toothpaste, I think to myself “you are not strong enough, if you were a Sarah you'd be strong enough, you'd be better, more alive.” Do you have any idea what that's like, to look yourself in the mirror and not recognize who this unremarkable not-sarah is that is staring back at you? I'll tell you. Imagine a world where everything is wonderful, a world where every time you had to wait in a line your brain just goes 'here have a very public yet private orgasm' and you just stand there cumming tenderly as you wait to buy some scented envelopes. A world where you are Sarah and – I assume – that kind of shit happens all the time. Now imagine that you're not Sarah; you're Meredith. No good, flat assed Meredith, who sucked at tetherball in middle school and who pretended to be really into baritones to get one of the marching band guys named Sal, a solid 5, to reluctantly touch a boob.  Merediths don't get tender orgasms, they get dudes named Sal to vomit on them after the bare minimum of sexual contact. I want to be a Sarah so badly that the part of my brain responsible for desire is eating all other parts of my brain so that it can grow stronger.</p> <p>Everything about the life of a Sarah is better than the life of a Meredith. Just look at the names. The name Sarah in hebrew means “princess or noblewoman”, how great is that? “Meredith” is the sound the people of inuit tribes make when trying to describe the sound of a she wolf's vagina fart. If you are a Sarah and you have to give the spelling of your name to somebody over the phone they'll ask you “Is that an 'S' as in 'sweet and lovely'?”, and if you're a Meredith they'll say “Is that an 'M' as in metastasizing at an alarming rate? Or mediocre and lousy in bed?”. Sarah is a name that communicates confidence and a bold inner strength. The name Meredith communicates that this person smells like tacos and gasoline.</p> <p>It's not just the name. Sarahs live better lifestyles too. For example Sarahs don't need money, they can walk into any store in the world and be handed whatever goods or services they need free of charge. Merediths have to carry around extra cash so that they can bribe business owners to let them shop in their stores. Do you understand what that means? Merediths have to spend money so that they can then spend more money. The fact of the matter is that a Sarah's life is so profoundly better than that of a Meredith that, when compared to the amount of raw life and unbound beauty a Sarah experiences on a daily basis, a Meredith is technically dead. You think I'm lying? There was a time where I went to the hospital for a routine check up and I had an appointment right after a Sarah and guess what? As soon as I walked in to see the doctor he grabbed my wrist, looked at his watch, and said “time of death, who cares, by the looks of it this girl is a Meredith, whew and she smells like tacos and gasoline. Nurse can you please go dump this thing outside?” When I explained to him that I was not dead and that I was alive he said, “But are you really? Are any of us non-sarahs really alive?”. Of course I said, “yeah I'm pretty sure we're alive,” but honestly, I'm not sure how much I believed it. Self doubt;  just another weakness shared by the world's Merediths.</p> <p>Let's face it. We're all just square pegs in a sarah hole. The laws of nature demand that somebody has to be on the top of the food chain, and those somebodies are the collective Sarahs on this planet. They don't give any fucks, not to anybody, not to you, not to Merediths, and especially not their fuck starved grandmothers. This is their world, and we're all just baring the agony of not being a Sarah in it.</p> <p> God, I want to be one of them. Why can't I be? After all, in the dark we're all Sarahs. If you cut a Sarah, wouldn't she bleed like the rest of us? Sure, maybe she'd bleed delicious corn syrup with micro diamonds in it, but she'd bleed none the less.  But try as I might, I'll never be a Sarah. I introduced myself as a Sarah to somebody once, and they told me that the likelihood of me being a Sarah is about the same as them being the second coming of Christ. They said they recognized the stench of a Meredith from a mile away, a smell indistinguishable from a food truck but with an added dash of neediness and alcoholism.</p> <p>But I guess I should just let bygones be bygones right? We can't all be born Sarahs. If we were then being a Sarah wouldn't mean anything, we'd be robbing the whole Sarah institution of its glamour. Some were meant to shine, others were meant to eat shit and be Merediths. But here is the thing. If it is the will of the hidden wisdom of the universe that it be so, then it is my will as a weird smelling bad bitch to do what I want. If I can't be a Sarah, and if I can't get the Sals of the world to just touch a tit already, then I'm going to redefine the Sarah/Meredith paradigm. Let's see how the Sarahs like being mistaken for a food truck or a domesticated grizzly bear. So no, I'm not a Sarah, please excuse me. I'm better than a Sarah. I'm somebody that really wants to be a Sarah, and really, those are the most outstanding and dangerous people there are. And in a sarah eat sarah world, those are valuable qualities. So look out, this Meredith is about to get real crazy.

ten_year_me = Writing.create(title: "Dear Ten Year Old Me, I'm So Much Better Than You Now", content: "<p>Dear Ten Year Old Me,</p><br>

    <p>Do you think I'm at all impressed with you and your pop tart crumb populated lips? Wow, show me again how cool it is that your spider-man action figure can bend at the elbows. Do you have any idea how little that interests me? So many toys can do that you imbecile, it's actually one of the most common features in action figures. That's like wanting to show me how wet water is. Oh how feeble your mind is ten year old me. It almost makes it unfair, my being better than you, but not quite.</p> 
    <p>What have I been up to these last thirteen years? Oh I don't know maybe doing a little something called bettering myself, have you heard of it? I doubt it, you don't know anything about struggle. You know, I can hold my breath for a good three and half minutes now. What's your time again? Oh yeah, like a minute fifteen or something unremarkable like that. Get out of here. I bet your underwear is on backwards too, unlike mine. I haven't accidentally put my underwear on backwards in months. I've also mastered winking, with my right and left eye. How do you like them pizza flavored Pringles, you half-conscious, sticky fingered, sack of ring-pop colored crap? Do you even know how to wink yet? Didn't think so. This is why people like Cameron and Colin got all the action back in fifth grade, while you were too busy trying to figure out the best way to make a dolphin noise, those guys mastered winking you fuck. By the way, a good dolphin noise comes from the diaphragm, not the throat.</p>
    <p>You are so lucky that I can't send this letter to you in person, because if we were both put in a room together and forced to fight, it would be no contest. I'd drop kick you so fast that I'd accidentally travel back in time and end up drop kicking you again, and again, and again, stuck in an infinite drop kicking loop. Your idiotic ten year old face wouldn't even be able to deal as your undeveloped brain just starts sobbing and vomiting as it takes on a barrage of kicks from an adult version of yourself. You're such a sniveling little baby, you're not even worth the effort. I know my times tables better than you and I know how to throw a punch better than you too, so seriously don't even try it.</p>
    <p>Also, you are amazingly boring. Get an interest already! The pain of listening to you talk is only amplified by the fact that I know that these words are the result of the cobbled together micro-thoughts of my own pre-legend status mind. I don't care where the grand canyon is! And, unless your favorite dinosaur is who-gives-a-single-shit than I will probably guess wrong. And honestly? You're gonna go with T-rex as your favorite? How contrived. My favorite dinosaur is the armored Euopolcephalus of the cretaceous period, it's pretty popular in the circles I run in. I guess it's kind of unfair to compare our tastes in dinosaurs on account of the fact that I'm kind of a socialite in dinosaur enthusiast circles now, and you still have a lingering fear of the dark. Still, come on, it's no excuse, you are the kind of boring that physically hurts people and you need to not be doing that as quickly as possible. Here's an idea, how about every time right before you are about to say something to me, you stop, think about it, and then leave me alone forever. Maybe go fill your face up with those pop tarts you love so much, and if you start to choke, congratulate yourself because you've finally found a way to appear at all interesting to me.</p>
    <p>This letter is exhausting to write, which I am going to chalk up to the labor involved in chronicling adult thoughts. There's a lot more nuance and complexity I have to sift through now in order to perfectly crystalize my typically abstract and higher level thoughts, but that's my cross to bare. Bare is a homophone of the word bear, did you know that? Do you even know what a homophone is? If you make a stupid joke about it being a homophone you'll only be proving my point.</p>
    <p>I'm going to leave you now with this ten year old me. I want you to remember that I am stronger than you, I am wiser than you, I am hands down a better speller than you, and have the kind of bladder control that would make the ladies of Spotswood Elementary School swoon in their plastic see-saw seats. So in all your endeavors keep that in mind, as you try to get better, upping your dinosaur knowledge and your general attitude on life, then one day when you're ready, we'll meet again and be a little more evenly matched. At the end of the day I'm only saying these things to you because I care. And with that, I gotta go, I just received this really scathing letter from fifty eight year old me and now I gotta go kick his geriatric ass.</p>".html_safe, image: "https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t31.0-8/1147494_10153725980835179_255056999_o.jpg")




band_name = Writing.create(title:"Me Telling You What You Should Name Your Band", content: "
 <p>So you think you’ve got the chops to start a band huh kid? Great! I hope you love sex, drugs, and whatever genre of music your band plays, because from here on out that’s all you’ve got coming for you. Still interested? Swell. I’m going to let you in on a secret that all music industry insiders want to keep on the hush hush; the only thing you need to be a really great band, is a really great name. For example, do you think that if the Beatles had stuck with their original name “The Mother Beating Beatles” that anybody would have listened to them? Maybe the punks would have dug it, but who wants those guys on their team? The name does ninety five percent of the heavy lifting, the other five percent is divvied up evenly between costuming, the minimization of groupie related collateral damage, conjuring up feebly constructed philosophies on peace that you’re going to want to espouse whenever being interviewed, and song writing. Let me repeat that again; a band’s name does ninety five percent of the heavy lifting. Nine-tee Fy-ve / cent. The obvious course of action here is to spend at least ninety five percent of your waking life thinking about the perfect name for your band. I know what you’re probably saying to yourself, “Can’t we just skip to all the rough sex and freaky-deaky third eye opening drugs? Who’s got time to come up with a great band name?” I do. So here my friend, is a comprehensive list of what I think you should name your band, one look at this and you’ll be well on your way to cocaine binges, and ripping sinks off of bathroom walls.</p><br>

<p><b>1)</b> <em>Aaaaah!!</em> – It’s dynamic, it’s fun, and best of all it’ll show up at the top of all iTunes libraries. That’s five whole A’s. Each one of them solidifying your position at the top, where you’ve belonged all along. Whenever anybody opens up any one of their terrific Apple™ products (Think Different) your band name will strike their optic-nerves like Thor’s thunderous hammer and leave such a calamitous impression on their minds that they won’t be able to forget you until science finally comes up with a memory laser, a laser that lasers memory. Which leads me to the next name →</p>

<p><b>2)</b> <em>Harry Hong Kong and the Memory Lasers</em> – While I feel like this band name requires almost no justification, I’m willing to enlighten non-believers. First of all, people love alliteration as evidenced by all the great characters in literature with alliterative names; Captain Crunch, Peter Parker, Big Bird, Willy Wonka, Jesus Christly Christ. The list goes on and on. And the whole ‘memory lasers’ bit is more of a social consciousness thing, as in I am socially incredibly conscious and would really like memory lasers to exist now so that I don’t have to think about how many people are getting screwed in life.</p>

<p><b>3)</b> <em>And Now Introducing and Now Introducing and Now Introducing</em> – This band name is hilarious. Whenever anybody is introducing this band they are gonna seem like they’re stuck in an infinite loop. Imagine it, somebody standing before a crowd saying “And Now Introducing and Now Introducing and Now Introducing and Now Introducing.” They’ll look like such a bozo! If you want to be internet savvy you can shorten the name to ANIANIANI, which makes it look like a Sound Cloud ready username.</p>

<p><b>4)</b> <em>Tupac – Fuck it</em>. Sometimes you gotta stand on the shoulders of giants.
There you have it. Pick one, make a deal with Satan, and take over the world</p>".html_safe, image: "http://www.heavyharmonies.com/bandpics/wildside.jpg",)



al_roker = Writing.create(title:"To My Father, Al Roker", content: "<p>Dear Dad,<p>

<p>My name is Kurtis Carmicheal. I know you don't know me, but boy do I know you. I guess that's not really saying anything special. Everyone on the planet knows who you are. You are Al 'the Pal' Roker, you are the warm thick syrup to America's diversity checkered waffle.<p>

<p>Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm a local news anchor from Roswell, New Mexico. That's right, that should ring a bell for you. Roswell, the same place that UFOs supposedly crash landed on American soil back in 1947. The same place where a budding young meteorologist with a Shaftro (A shaft inspired afro), visited in 1979 in order to study New Mexican wind abnormalities. It wasn't long before that young meteorologist found out that the wind wasn't the only thing that was abnormal about New Mexico. The women in that south western town were different, exotic, white. And one of those women stuck out to you just a little bit more than the others. She had the face of an angel, and the arms of a gorilla, and though her name was Chastity, you knew that she had everything but. And I mean <em>everything</em>. You admired her honesty and the way she mispronounced the word mirror to sound more like 'meer', but even more so you admired her athleticism, as she was the best damn shot put thrower Roswell, New Mexico had ever seen. It's no surprise that you took to her like abnormal winds take to New Mexico, and the two of you made southwestern chipotle sauce flavored love for two weeks straight, after which you disappeared in order to fulfill your destiny of telling America every weekday morning whether or not they should wear a coat, a hoodie, or what.<p>

<p>Nine months after your two week tryst with my mother, I was born. According to mom I was just like you as a toddler, I would stand by the living room window trying to give a weather report with my hands down my pants and then say 'And here's what's happening in your neck of the woods.' I would be on the chubby side one day, and then I would slim down but not look quite right the next. I know I was just a baby, but I feel like I was also you. Not wanting to step on any toes, however, instead of becoming a meteorologist I thought it would be a good idea to lead my own life and be my own man, so I became a reporter specializing in bizarre weather occurrences. Having learned from the best it wasn't long before I made anchor on Roswell's on KRWS-4 news team.<p>

<p>But I am not writing you to talk to you about my history, I'm writing to talk to you about <em>our</em> future. I've spent, oh, I don't know I suppose a good thirty odd years ruminating about this and I think it might be a good idea if the two of us meet up. Think about it, Al Roker, America's anointed one, reuniting with his long lost son from New Mexico, ready to have episodic adventures against weather themed terror organizations with names like 'The Hurripains' or 'A Horror Borealis' okay those are terrible names but you know what I'm trying to say dad! You and me! Al and Kurt. I'll be the Owen Wilson to your Jackie Chan in our own rendition of Shanghai Noon, I chose shanghai noon because So far I've established this sort of southwestern theme and I thought it would be wise to stick with it. If you want you can be Owen Wilson.<p>

<p>Also.. Mother is dying. There were kids playing with these toy helicopters and when they lost control of them the helicoptoys seemed drawn to her. Feeling attacked mother started to furiously swing at the things only to find that they wouldn't let up, which led to her trying to dash desperately to safety. But mother, never one to pay attention to her surroundings, ended up running into an electric fence. It was the least funny thing I've ever kind of laughed at.<p>

<p>In any case, now that I've got your address you can definitely expect more letters from me. I have to spend a lot of time with mom in the hospital and there's not much to do but to write these bad boys. I am looking forward to our future correspondence.<p>

<p>And dad, I just want you to know that without you in my life, everyday is a partly cloudy.<p>

<p>May the winds forever whisper over your beautiful bald head,<p>
