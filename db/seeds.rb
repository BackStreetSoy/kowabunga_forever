band_name = Writing.create(title:"Me Telling You What You Should Name Your Band", content: "
 <p>So you think you’ve got the chops to start a band huh kid? Great! I hope you love sex, drugs, and whatever genre of music your band plays, because from here on out that’s all you’ve got coming for you. Still interested? Swell. I’m going to let you in on a secret that all music industry insiders want to keep on the hush hush; the only thing you need to be a really great band, is a really great name. For example, do you think that if the Beatles had stuck with their original name “The Mother Beating Beatles” that anybody would have listened to them? Maybe the punks would have dug it, but who wants those guys on their team? The name does ninety five percent of the heavy lifting, the other five percent is divvied up evenly between costuming, the minimization of groupie related collateral damage, conjuring up feebly constructed philosophies on peace that you’re going to want to espouse whenever being interviewed, and song writing. Let me repeat that again; a band’s name does ninety five percent of the heavy lifting. Nine-tee Fy-ve / cent. The obvious course of action here is to spend at least ninety five percent of your waking life thinking about the perfect name for your band. I know what you’re probably saying to yourself, “Can’t we just skip to all the rough sex and freaky-deaky third eye opening drugs? Who’s got time to come up with a great band name?” I do. So here my friend, is a comprehensive list of what I think you should name your band, one look at this and you’ll be well on your way to cocaine binges, and ripping sinks off of bathroom walls.</p><br>

<p><b>1)</b> <em>Aaaaah!!</em> – It’s dynamic, it’s fun, and best of all it’ll show up at the top of all iTunes libraries. That’s five whole A’s. Each one of them solidifying your position at the top, where you’ve belonged all along. Whenever anybody opens up any one of their terrific Apple™ products (Think Different) your band name will strike their optic-nerves like Thor’s thunderous hammer and leave such a calamitous impression on their minds that they won’t be able to forget you until science finally comes up with a memory laser, a laser that lasers memory. Which leads me to the next name →</p>

<p><b>2)</b> <em>Harry Hong Kong and the Memory Lasers</em> – While I feel like this band name requires almost no justification, I’m willing to enlighten non-believers. First of all, people love alliteration as evidenced by all the great characters in literature with alliterative names; Captain Crunch, Peter Parker, Big Bird, Willy Wonka, Jesus Christly Christ. The list goes on and on. And the whole ‘memory lasers’ bit is more of a social consciousness thing, as in I am socially incredibly conscious and would really like memory lasers to exist now so that I don’t have to think about how many people are getting screwed in life.</p>

<p><b>3)</b> <em>And Now Introducing and Now Introducing and Now Introducing</em> – This band name is hilarious. Whenever anybody is introducing this band they are gonna seem like they’re stuck in an infinite loop. Imagine it, somebody standing before a crowd saying “And Now Introducing and Now Introducing and Now Introducing and Now Introducing.” They’ll look like such a bozo! If you want to be internet savvy you can shorten the name to ANIANIANI, which makes it look like a Sound Cloud ready username.</p>

<p><b>4)</b> <em>Tupac – Fuck it</em>. Sometimes you gotta stand on the shoulders of giants.
There you have it. Pick one, make a deal with Satan, and take over the world</p>".html_safe, image: "http://www.heavyharmonies.com/bandpics/wildside.jpg",)


talent_agent = Writing.create(title: "Wanted: A Talent Agent Willing to Play Ball", content: "<p><b>Please contact: 314-159-2653</b></p>
          <p><b>email: dollypartoncoverartist@gmail.com</b></p>
          <b>Ideal Candidate for this position:</b>
<p>I’m looking for somebody that is some sort of ethnic caricature. Preferably Jewish, but I am very flexible on this point, though for practical reasons any one of Aboriginal Australian descent should not bother applying. The more boisterously ethnic you are the more likely it is that you will get hired, and if it helps you get a gauge for the kind of thing I’m looking for I will say that my last talent agent was the Native American from the village people. Aboriginal Australians aside, I am an equal opportunity employer.</p>
<p>Besides having the ethnic credentials, the ideal candidate for the Talent Agent position in my life should be somebody that looks incredible yelling at people on the phone while wearing a blazer. I’m not going to tip toe around this, there are a lot of people angry with me right now and they all somehow know my professional phone number, and getting heated while sticking up for me is going to take up a large portion of your job (more on this later). And if there’s anything I’ve learned while writing this job listing, it is that I really enjoy the look of somebody that’s pissed off and in a blazer.</p>
  <p>You should also be comfortable around the following items: Beakers and other laboratory equipment, mouse traps, repurposed tampons (used mostly for arts and craft projects), Bob Marley paraphernalia, half-completed maps, jars of human bodily fluids, ignored eviction notices, end of days blue prints, fetuses of my clones. Must also love cats.</p>
<p>So that’s what I’m looking for. No funny business! If you are not serious, don’t contact me! If you are serious. Please – continue reading.</p>
Job Description:<br>
<p><b>1)</b> Who you will be working for – An extraordinarily talented guy. I’m a lean, mean, rude, dude, with tons of attitude. I love meat, don’t understand the meaning of defeat, and I’ve got bug eyes, with fat thighs, I’m a cool cat, that loves to try on hats, I’ve got cousins in Minnesota but I’m trying to cut back on that flat jack soda. I don’t believe in bees from Belize, and I can’t stand to sneeze cheese, so if that’s something you can’t handle then I suggest you make like my cousin Randall and leave me the fuck alone.</p>
<p><b>2)</b>What you will be expected to do:</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b>Get certain crime families off of my scent. If anybody with a thick sicilian accent calls for me just yell the phrase, “NEVER HEARD OF HIM!” and hang up. Don’t worry, we’ll go over this during orientation.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Keeping samples of my DNA safe. Pretty straight forward.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Recount my favorite TV show episodes back to me.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Have a catch phrase. Remember, if you were hired it’s because you are some kind of hyperbolic ethnic stereotype, which means you’re expected to have a catch phrase. Samples include, but are not limited to <b>[omitted by the board of job placement on the grounds of incredible indecency]</b> !!!</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Not ask any questions.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Get me gigs.</p>
<p><b>Wage:</b> I’m sort of going through an “in between” period in my life right now, so for the first six months of your stint with me I’m going to have to pay you strictly in rupees (if you turned out to be an Indian caricature then this shouldn’t be a problem right?)</p>
<p><b>Final Notes:</b> In the end I’m just a laid-back jeans and t-shirt kind of guy, please don’t think of me as a ‘celebrity’, ‘Ubermensch’, or any of those other words people have been throwing around lately. In the end I’m just like you, except in a position of authority and will expect to be treated as such.
Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>".html_safe, image: "http://www.keithrlaskey.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/happy-young-businesswoman.jpg")

al_roker = Writing.create(title:"To My Father, Al Roker", content: "<p>Dear Dad,<p>

<p>My name is Kurtis Carmicheal. I know you don't know me, but boy do I know you. I guess that's not really saying anything special. Everyone on the planet knows who you are. You are Al 'the Pal' Roker, you are the warm thick syrup to America's diversity checkered waffle.<p>

<p>Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm a local news anchor from Roswell, New Mexico. That's right, that should ring a bell for you. Roswell, the same place that UFOs supposedly crash landed on American soil back in 1947. The same place where a budding young meteorologist with a Shaftro (A shaft inspired afro), visited in 1979 in order to study New Mexican wind abnormalities. It wasn't long before that young meteorologist found out that the wind wasn't the only thing that was abnormal about New Mexico. The women in that south western town were different, exotic, white. And one of those women stuck out to you just a little bit more than the others. She had the face of an angel, and the arms of a gorilla, and though her name was Chastity, you knew that she had everything but. And I mean <em>everything</em>. You admired her honesty and the way she mispronounced the word mirror to sound more like 'meer', but even more so you admired her athleticism, as she was the best damn shot put thrower Roswell, New Mexico had ever seen. It's no surprise that you took to her like abnormal winds take to New Mexico, and the two of you made southwestern chipotle sauce flavored love for two weeks straight, after which you disappeared in order to fulfill your destiny of telling America every weekday morning whether or not they should wear a coat, a hoodie, or what.<p>

<p>Nine months after your two week tryst with my mother, I was born. According to mom I was just like you as a toddler, I would stand by the living room window trying to give a weather report with my hands down my pants and then say 'And here's what's happening in your neck of the woods.' I would be on the chubby side one day, and then I would slim down but not look quite right the next. I know I was just a baby, but I feel like I was also you. Not wanting to step on any toes, however, instead of becoming a meteorologist I thought it would be a good idea to lead my own life and be my own man, so I became a reporter specializing in bizarre weather occurrences. Having learned from the best it wasn't long before I made anchor on Roswell's on KRWS-4 news team.<p>

<p>But I am not writing you to talk to you about my history, I'm writing to talk to you about <em>our</em> future. I've spent, oh, I don't know I suppose a good thirty odd years ruminating about this and I think it might be a good idea if the two of us meet up. Think about it, Al Roker, America's anointed one, reuniting with his long lost son from New Mexico, ready to have episodic adventures against weather themed terror organizations with names like 'The Hurripains' or 'A Horror Borealis' okay those are terrible names but you know what I'm trying to say dad! You and me! Al and Kurt. I'll be the Owen Wilson to your Jackie Chan in our own rendition of Shanghai Noon, I chose shanghai noon because So far I've established this sort of southwestern theme and I thought it would be wise to stick with it. If you want you can be Owen Wilson.<p>

<p>Also.. Mother is dying. There were kids playing with these toy helicopters and when they lost control of them the helicoptoys seemed drawn to her. Feeling attacked mother started to furiously swing at the things only to find that they wouldn't let up, which led to her trying to dash desperately to safety. But mother, never one to pay attention to her surroundings, ended up running into an electric fence. It was the least funny thing I've ever kind of laughed at.<p>

<p>In any case, now that I've got your address you can definitely expect more letters from me. I have to spend a lot of time with mom in the hospital and there's not much to do but to write these bad boys. I am looking forward to our future correspondence.<p>

<p>And dad, I just want you to know that without you in my life, everyday is a partly cloudy.<p>

<p>May the winds forever whisper over your beautiful bald head,<p>
